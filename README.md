# caesarianCipher

## Description: This program allows a user to encrypt or decrpyt secret messages using the Caesarian Cipher Algorithm (a simple key shift). I've included 78 characters to my chars array, including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and some symbols, but more could easily be added. If a character is not in the char array, it simply stays as itself when encrypted or decrypted.

I completed this project in order to teach myself C# syntax.

### Installs and Running
Install C# and .net on your local computer.

Run using ```dotnet run```.
