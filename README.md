# caesarianCipher

This program allows a user to encrypt or decrpyt secret messages using the Caesarian Cipher Algorith (a simple key shift). I've included 78 characters to my chars array, including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and some symbols, but more could easily be added. If a character is not in the char array, it simply stays as itself when encrypted or decrypted.

I completed this project in order to teach myself C# syntax in preparation for a job interview with Nuvasive.

My students have coded this concept in python and javascript, so although I've helepd them when they have gotten stuck, I've never done it myself.

I used documentation online to look up the following concepts in C#, arrays, loops, string methods, methods, user input.
